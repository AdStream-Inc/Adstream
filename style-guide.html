		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Syntax" class="section-title">Syntax</h3>
			<p>Use multi line CSS to keep readability high, meaning there 
			should be no single line declarations even if there is only 1 attribute 
			being modified. When dealing with multiple selectors each new selector 
			should be placed on a new line follow by a comma. Always use a trailing 
			semi colon to keep the document less error prone across the lifespan of 
			development.</p>
<pre>
.example,
.another-example{
		background: blue;
		color: green;
}
</pre>
			<p>When dealing with vendor prefixes keep all colons lined up.</p>
<pre>
.transition{
		-webkit-transition: all; 
		   -moz-transition: all;  
			    -o-transition: all;
}
</pre>
			<p>Multiple attribute values should be set on a new line and tabbed.</p>
<pre>
.text-shadow{
		text-shadow:
			&nbsp;0 1px 0 #000,
			&nbsp;0 -1px 0 #fff;
}
</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="SelectorFormatting" class="section-title">Selector Formatting</h3>
			<p>Use hyphen delimited, lowercase selectors e.g. <code>.dropdown-content</code>. 
			Make class names <em>sensible</em> to allow for
			greater comprehension of what the class is doing in the CSS, <code>.d-cnt</code> is bad 
			<code>.dropdown-content</code> is good. When dealing with prefixes try and giving meaning 
			to the prefix of the selector when applicable. For example if you know that you 
			want to add a selector inside <code>.dropdown</code> then prefix the selector
			with <code>.dropdown</code> e.g. <code>.dropdown-content</code>. Keep this naming convention when dealing with component 
			states e.g. <code>.is-active</code> or <code>.js-hover</code>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="SelectorSpecificity" class="section-title">Selector Specificity</h3>
			<p>Keep all selectors short, efficient, and portable. Large selectors make 
			your css fragile and do not allow the element to exist in multiple surroundings, for this reason keep selectors less than 3 levels deep. For example <code>.sidebar 
			ul span</code> is not a very efficient selector because the <code>span</code> that is being styled can 
			only live inside of <code>ul</code> that <em><strong>also</strong></em> lives inside of <code>.sidebar</code>. A better solution would be 
			to use <code>.sidebar-title</code> so that the object at hand can live anywhere in the html. Keeping selectors 
			short and explicit makes for greater code reusability and maintainability.</p>
			<p>Selectors should not be prefixed with any parent element, this keeps the classes 
			abstract and reusable. For instance lets take the selector <code>ul.nav li a</code>. The <code>ul</code> parent 
			element is not needed here for two reasons; we already know this element being 
			styled is going to be a list, and what if we wanted to use this selector to style both a <code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code>? At its current state that would
			require us to use two selectors to make sure both <code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code> are styled the same.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Assumptions" class="section-title">Dont Make Assumptions</h3>
			<p>Instead of building a selector that targets an assumed element such <code>.island a</code>, it is 
			often more robust to put a class name on the element. What happens if we remove that <code>a</code> in our html and replace it 
			with a <code>span</code>? The selector <code>.island a</code> no longer is valid and has to be restructured. 
			Instead use something like <code>.island-tagline</code> that way no matter what element lives inside 
			the <code>.island</code> object it will be styled correctly.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Shorthand" class="section-title">Shorthand</h3>
			<p>Be extremely explicit when declaring selector attributes. It may be appealing to use 
			<code>background: red</code>, however by using that declaration you are 
			actually saying &#8220;I want no image to scroll, aligned top left and repeating X and Y and a 
			background colour of red&#8221;. In most cases this will not be an issue but in the seldom 
			occurances it does happen, being explicit can really help out with troubleshooting.</p>
<pre>
.foo{
		background-color: red;
		margin-left: 4px;
}
</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="OOCSS" class="section-title">Code Reuse and OOCSS</h3>
			<p>When building components try and keep things as DRY and portable as possible. Instead 
			of building dozens of unique components, try and spot repeated design patterns and 
			abstract them. Start with base "skeleton" components and then add classes onto these to 
			extend their styling for more unique circumstances.</p>
			<p>If you have to build a new component split it into structure and skin. Build the 
			structure or "skeleton" of the component using very generic classes that can be reused 
			and then use more specific classes to skin it up and add design treatments.</p>
			<p>When developing HTML components try and use as little extra markup 
			as possible. This not only keeps your HTML lean it also increases portability within your 
			CSS and allows your selectors to be even more explicit. As an example when creating a 
			navigation block instead of using:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="nav"&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div>
</pre>
			<p>use</p>
<pre>
&lt;ul class="nav"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Extension" class="section-title">Object Extension</h3>
			<p>Before designing a new component take time to make sure that it has not already been created, or that an existing
			component can be <em>extended</em> apon to fit your needs. Its worth
			mentioning the open/close principle in object oriented design. It basically states that components are always open to <em>extension</em> but closed to <em>modification</em>, 
			meaning that with just a single class you can potentially change the structure of a component
			altogether. Therefore when utilizing CSS objects it is imperative to keep the open/close principle in mind. 
			An easy example of component extension
			is extending the <code>.nav</code> abstraction for a sites main navigation.</p>
<pre>
&lt;ul class="nav nav-main"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
		<p>Now all we have to call is our <code>.nav-main</code> selector to modify the <em>"skin"</em> of our navigation, since it is inheriting the structure of the <code>.nav</code> abstraction. As an
		added bonus if we need to change the structure of the <code>.nav</code> abstraction for any means it can be completely done through the <code>.nav-main</code> class
		making our code contained and portable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Layout" class="section-title">Layout</h3><a href="grid-test.html">Demo of Grid System</a>
			<p>All components should be totally free of widths. They should remain fluid and have 
			their widths set by the grid system. Tru not to assign heights to anything but a grid, most 
			components should have their heights adjusted purely from padding or line-height.</p>
			<p>The actual layout of the site should exclusively rely on the grid system and nothing 
			else. Think of it as a bookshelf, the grids are the holes to put your "books" or components 
			in. This way we can ensure that everything will degrade gracefully at lower resolutions. 
			Think of the grids as almost static and constant, meaning that no visual or box model 
			styles should be applied to them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Typography" class="section-title">Typography</h3>
			<p>All typography is automatically sized and set to a consistant vertical rhythm, 
			components should follow this vertical rhythm as well. Line heights should be set without a unit 
			measurement. All font sizes should be applied in em's with a pixel
			fallback to allow for responsive sizing determined by viewport size.</p>
			<p>Before declaring a font size in a selector check and make sure it is not already declared. 
			Header tag sizes have been designed to be interchangeable in size, meaning that if you want a 
			<code>h1</code> to look like a <code>h3</code> you can simply use <code>&lt;h1 class="h3"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="GoldenNumber" class="section-title">Golden Number</h3>
			<p>To keep optimal readability always use a "golden number" (or numbers divisible by the 
			golden number) when dealing with margins or paddings. This number is derived from our line
			height which is determined by taking the base font size (16) and multiplying it by 150% 
			(1.5) which equals 24. Math is awesome.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3 id="Important" class="section-title">!important</h3>
			<p>It is okay to use <code>!important</code> on helper classes that you want to take precedence such as
			<code>.left{ float: left!important }</code>. Using <code>!important</code> to get yourself out of nasty specificity 
			situations, is not advised. Rework your CSS and try  to combat these issues by refactoring 
			your selectors. Keeping your selectors short explicit will help out here massively.</p>
